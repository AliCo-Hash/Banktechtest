# Bank tech test

Today, you'll practice doing a tech test.

For most tech tests, you'll essentially have unlimited time.  This practice session is about producing the best code you can when there is a minimal time pressure.

You'll get to practice your OO design and TDD skills.

You'll work alone, and you'll also review your own code so you can practice reflecting on and improving your own work.

## Specification

### Requirements

* You should be able to interact with your code via a REPL like IRB or Node.  (You don't need to implement a command line interface that takes input from STDIN.)
* Deposits, withdrawal.
* Account statement (date, amount, balance) printing.
* Data can be kept in memory (it doesn't need to be stored to a database or anything).

### Acceptance criteria

**Given** a client makes a deposit of 1000 on 10-01-2023  
**And** a deposit of 2000 on 13-01-2023  
**And** a withdrawal of 500 on 14-01-2023  
**When** she prints her bank statement  
**Then** she would see

```
date || credit || debit || balance
14/01/2023 || || 500.00 || 2500.00
13/01/2023 || 2000.00 || || 3000.00
10/01/2023 || 1000.00 || || 1000.00
```

# Approach

* Initially decided to just make a simple deposit and withdraw function.
* Assumed user will not be putting in the date and it will be created when the client uses a deposit/withdraw function which then gets pushed into an array to save.
* Not sure if I should be testing if the date function is being done correctly.
* A few edge cases that I found were that the amount can go to 0 or minus numbers(can write an if/else statement to throw an error if done so).
* Another edge case will be the make sure that the amount is an Integer/Float.
